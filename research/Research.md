## VSE Project 

- Also, look at how the graph modules are bound on the simple structures 
- Read the Detection Transformers Paper from Facebook
-  MS COCO Dataset: Image to Sentence Retrieval, Sentence to Image Retrieval 
- have read papers with really complicated architecture: ACMM paper has the best approach I was looking for 
- But need to understand, probably write a visualization paper?
- SimClr embeddings vs Contrastive Embeddings vs Visual Embeddings vs  Language Models?
- To make vision language modular interfaces
- See code are available,  datasets used,  experiments will be done etc
