# Research

## Visual NLP Project

- Aligned Cross-Modal Memory
* SimClr embeddings vs Visual Embeddings vs Language Models Embedding
* Some kind of Modular Interface between Vision and Language 
* See code are available, datasets used, Experiments will be done etc

## Reinforcement Learning Robots: Embodied AI

* Agent performance in real vs simulated world
* The embodiment of Robot: How will it work, degrees of freedom, control
* How will be agent perform in the real world

## Video Accelerator

* Finish the analytical comparison of FLOPS b/w Video Compression H.265/H.264 and DVC&#x20;
* Propose a method of the couple that reduces the flops&#x20;
* Point out the data movement b/w different chipsets of Vid-Transcoder and NN-accelerator

Opportunities : 

* High-Performance Differential Processor for Edge Training,

Vision : EdgeX: Edge-AI Infrastructure

* Energy-Efficient Accelerator Design by Coupling Video Understanding and Compression.&#x20;

Framework :

- Propose an Edge Framework for Efficient Data Understanding, Compression and Transmission

Notes :

- Robustness of Deep Learning-based Video Compression Techniques
- What is the power consumption ratio of decoding and displaying to the power consumption of streaming?
